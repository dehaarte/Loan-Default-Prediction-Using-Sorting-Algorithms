<H1> COP3530 - Project 3 </h1>



This program predicts the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on loans by analyzing key financial and demographic attributes. It calculates a risk score for each borrower using weighted factors such as credit score, income, and loan amount, and predicts default status based on a threshold.

The program allows users to sort the dataset by various attributes using Heap Sort or Merge Sort and displays the results. It also provides a feature to compare the performance of both sorting algorithms, helping users choose the most efficient method for their data.

To run the program, compile the code using g++ and ensure the Loan_default.csv dataset is in the same directory. The program operates through a simple menu, allowing users to sort data, compare algorithms, and view results interactively.
